### The AMS System by Bambulab

The **AMS** system from Bambulab allows 3D printing with up to four different filaments without manual spool changes. It uses automatic filament recognition (**RFID**) and automatic spool changing (**ABC**). The AMS is also equipped with a filament drying system to improve print quality.

![AMS](/assets/docs/bambulab/bambulab-2.png)

### The Extruder

The **extruder** pulls the filament and feeds it into the heated body. The extruder of the Bambulab X1 Carbon is a direct extruder, located above the print bed, offering better control over the filament’s temperature and pressure.

![Extruder](/assets/docs/bambulab/bambulab-3.png)

### The Heated Body

The filament enters the heated body, where it is melted and extruded through the nozzle. The heated body is equipped with a heating cartridge and a temperature sensor to control the filament temperature.

![Heated Body](/assets/docs/bambulab/bambulab-4.png)

### The Build Plate

The **build plate** is the surface on which the print is made. It is heated to improve filament adhesion and can be textured or equipped with removable surfaces to facilitate print removal.

![Build Plate](/assets/docs/bambulab/bambulab-5.png)

### Slicing Software

A **slicer** converts your 3D model into printing instructions. In this guide, we will use **OrcaSlicer**, an advanced slicer compatible with most 3D printers.

![Software](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-1.png)

#### Importing Your 3D Model

1. Download a 3D model from platforms like [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/), [Printables](https://www.printables.com/), [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), [Cults](https://cults3d.com/), or [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/).
2. Import the model into OrcaSlicer by clicking on "Import."

![Importation](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-2.png)

#### Creating the Printing Context

1. Configure the printer in the software (model, nozzle diameter, build plate size, material).
2. Choose the type of build plate (smooth, textured, technical).
3. Select the filament for each file.
4. Set the layer height to adjust the print quality.

![Contexte](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-3.png)

#### Positioning the Object on the Build Plate

Choose the object’s orientation for technical and aesthetic reasons. FDM printing leaves visible layer lines, so choose the orientation wisely.

![Layers](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-4.png)

#### Defining the Infill of the Part

1. Adjust the infill density to control the strength and weight of the print.
2. Choose from different infill patterns (honeycomb, gyroid, grid).

![Infill](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-5.png)

#### Creating Supports

Supports are necessary for printing overhanging parts. Enable supports and choose between geometric and organic types.

![Supports](/assets/docs/orca/orcaslicer-6.png)

- Critical processing time.
- Handling continuous video streams.
- Minimal latency for instant response.

## Multiprocessing & embedded AI

### Introduction

Welcome to this part of the workshop where we will talk about optimization and **real-time processing**. In our case, we need to process a **continuous video stream**, perform **fast inference**, and **send an alert** as quickly as possible.

To achieve this, we will use **multiprocessing** to parallelize tasks and avoid bottlenecks!

### Hardware & Preparation

We will use:

- **Raspberry Pi 5** (8 GB RAM)
- **PiCamera Module 3**: MAX 30 FPS / 12Mpx
- **Battery or power adapter**

Now that we know the Raspberry Pi, we can explore its ecosystem, including its range of cameras:

One of the main sites to find hardware:

![alt text](/assets/blog/welcome/kubii.png)

#### Challenges & Constraints

We are in a **100% offline context**, so we need to **maximize the performance** of our embedded system by focusing on:

- **CPU & RAM optimization**
- **Multiprocessing** to run multiple tasks in parallel
- **Choosing the right video resolution** to avoid overloading the processing
- **Reducing latency** for optimal response time

### Workshop Steps

We will design a program **divided into several modules**, each running in **parallel** using multiprocessing.

#### Step 1: Creating Modules

1. **Video Acquisition**
   - Capture the continuous video stream.
2. **Inference with YOLO**
   - Detect **human intrusion** using a [**YOLO** model](https://docs.ultralytics.com/en).
3. **Alert on Intrusion**
   - If a person is detected, display a message.
4. **Real-Time Display**
   - Show the video with **bounding boxes** around intruders.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment

- **Create a virtual environment** to isolate dependencies:

In your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv ENV_NAME
```

- **Install the required libraries** (`opencv`, `ultralytics`, `picamera2`)

In your venv:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here is the content of the `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
ultralytics
opencv-python
websockets
picamera2
fastapi
uvicorn
streamlit
```

#### Step 3: Multiprocessing in Action

We will run each module in a **separate process** to optimize the processing of the video stream in **real-time**!

![multiproc architecture](/assets/blog/welcome/multiproc.png)

Here is a possible code structure:

```python
import multiprocessing
import cv2
from ultralytics import YOLO
from picamera2 import Picamera2
from multiprocessing import Queue
import numpy as np

def acquisition(queue: Queue) -> None:
    """
    Capture images from the Raspberry Pi camera and place them in a queue.

    Args:
        queue (Queue): Queue to store captured images.
    """
    picam2 = Picamera2()
    picam2.configure(picam2.create_preview_configuration(main={"size": (640, 640)}))
    picam2.start()

    while True:
        frame = picam2.capture_array()
        frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        queue.put(frame)

def inference(frame_queue: Queue, alert_queue: Queue, display_queue: Queue) -> None:
    """
    Perform inference with YOLOv8 to detect objects and send results.

    Args:
        frame_queue (Queue): Queue containing images to process.
        alert_queue (Queue): Queue to send alerts if a person is detected.
        display_queue (Queue): Queue to display annotated images.
    """
    model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # Load the YOLOv8 model
    while True:
        frame = frame_queue.get()  # Get an image from the queue
        results = model(frame)  # Detect objects

        # Create a copy of the image to show only people
        frame_persons = frame.copy()

        for result in results:
            for box in result.boxes:
                cls = int(box.cls[0])  # Class of the detected object
                if cls == 0:  # Class 0 = person
                    alert_queue.put("Person detected!")
                    # Draw bounding boxes only around people
                    x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box.xyxy[0])  # Box coordinates
                    cv2.rectangle(frame_persons, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                    cv2.putText(frame_persons, "Person", (x1, y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)

        display_queue.put(frame_persons)

def display_results(display_queue: Queue) -> None:
    """
    Display the results of the detection in real-time.

    Args:
        display_queue (Queue): Queue containing annotated images to display.
    """
    cv2.namedWindow("Person Detection", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)

    while True:
        frame = display_queue.get()
        cv2.imshow("Person Detection", frame)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

def alert_system(alert_queue: Queue) -> None:
    """
    Handle alerts when a person is detected.

    Args:
        alert_queue (Queue): Queue containing alert messages.
    """
    while True:
        message = alert_queue.get()
        print(f"WARNING {message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    frame_queue: Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
    alert_queue: Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
    display_queue: Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()

    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=acquisition, args=(frame_queue,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=inference, args=(frame_queue, alert_queue, display_queue))
    p3 = multiprocessing.Process(target=alert_system, args=(alert_queue,))
    p4 = multiprocessing.Process(target=display_results, args=(display_queue,))

    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p3.start()
    p4.start()

    p1.join()
    p2.join()
    p3.join()
    p4.join()
```

### Expected Results

- The camera captures a **continuous video stream**
- YOLO inference detects a **human presence**
- An alert is sent as soon as an **intrusion** is detected
- Everything runs **in parallel and in real-time**

### Conclusion & Improvements

Bravo! You have set up a **real-time surveillance system** on an **embedded device**!

**Possible Improvements**:

- **Optimize memory management** to prevent leaks.
- **Resize images** to reduce processing load.
- **Apply quantization** to speed up inference.
- **Add a server mode** to send alerts over a local network.

### BONUS: What is Quantization in AI?

Quantization is a technique used in artificial intelligence, particularly to optimize deep learning models so they run more efficiently on resource-limited devices.

A deep learning model uses:

- weights
- activations

All represented as float32 (32 bits).

Quantization reduces the precision of these values by converting them to int8 (8-bit integers), which decreases the model size and speeds up execution, while often maintaining acceptable performance.

Ultimately, we get a lighter model that is faster to load into RAM and infer.

Since we are using YOLO from the [ultralytics library](https://docs.ultralytics.com/fr/integrations/ncnn/#installation), let’s see how this applies to our case:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the YOLO11 model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

# Export the model to NCNN format
model.export(format="ncnn")  # creates '/yolo11n_ncnn_model'

# Load the exported NCNN model
ncnn_model = YOLO("./yolo11n_ncnn_model")

# Run inference
results = ncnn_model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
```

Try running this program again with our new network loaded!

## Conclusion

You now have all the basics to deploy embedded AI on Raspberry Pi and other devices!
